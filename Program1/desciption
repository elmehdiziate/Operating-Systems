The Monte Carlo method of approximating π is as follows:

Given a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 1 and a square bounding the circle (with side length 2),
generate random points that fall within the square.  π is approximately (4 x number of points in circle 
/ total number of points), as the number of points approaches infinity.
