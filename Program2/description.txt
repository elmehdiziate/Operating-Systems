You are the celebrity manager of the famous Chuck Hardabs and it is time for him to take group pictures 
with his adoring fans.  Fans arrive, look at the Hardabs exhibit for a little while, get in line for a
picture, get their picture taken, and leave.  However, Chuck has some restrictions for you.  
He takes naps in between pictures and refuses to be awoken until a minimum number of people are 
ready for the group picture.  Also, if too many people are in line at a time, he gets claustrophobic and 
freaks out.  If the line is full, the fans should wait in the exhibit area until a spot in line opens up.
